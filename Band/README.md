<a href="https://github.com/JSMcLallen/161-Collective.github.io/blob/main/index.html"> Band Website </a>

We weren't able to access the actual website with the url for it, so I just linked our github with the code in it.  

One issue we faced was that after Julian shared with me the index.html file he had created, we found that we weren't able to see the edits each other were making. 
Instead what we did was I added everything I was writing into a Google Doc we shared, and Julian copy pasted that into the index.html file. 
To write the code, we used the code from the sample website as a reference. 
We also decided to add images of each of ourselves to the website, and I airdropped my image to his computer.
We added a hyperlink for a song (not actually our song) at the end of the code.

We each contributed equally in coming up with ideas for the band and how to make the website, as well as for writing the bios.
Julian did most of the code writing, as the index.html file we were pushing to the github was on his computer. 
However, I realize now that I could have contributed more with writing the code by putting the code in the Google Doc we had shared so that he could copy paste that into the index.html file.
